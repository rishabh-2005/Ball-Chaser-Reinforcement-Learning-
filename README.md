This Unity project features an agent trained using reinforcement learning algorithms through Unity ML-Agents, designed to interact with a ball within a simulated environment. Leveraging Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Soft Actor-Critic (SAC) algorithms, the agent learns to manipulate its actions to achieve predefined objectives. The environment, constructed within Unity, provides a platform for observing the agent's learning process and behavior adaptation over time. Through trial and error, the agent refines its strategies, demonstrating the power of reinforcement learning in virtual environments. With customizable parameters, users can experiment with various training configurations to observe diverse agent behaviors. The project encourages exploration and understanding of reinforcement learning concepts within the Unity ecosystem, serving as both an educational resource and a platform for further research and development in artificial intelligence and game development domains.
